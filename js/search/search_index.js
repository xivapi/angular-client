By default the list just provides the ID, and result provides every column.\nYou can request specific pieces of information from a list or result by plugging in the column names.\nFor extended content you use dot notation to access it, for example:\nTo access the data in Items or a search on the Items index, you could request with these columns:\ncolumns=Items.0.Name,Items.1.Name\nIf you imagine an array having 50 items, this could be tedious and will eat into your maximum column count.\nYou can therefore use a count format, eg:\ncolumns=Items.*50.Name\nThis will return 50 rows from the column Items using the index Name\nThere are restrictions on the number of columns you can query, the column character length and the maximum items.\nBy default these are pretty strict so it is recommended to create a Developer App to be provided a key to increase your limits.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        extraQueryParams\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        extraQueryParams:     literal type\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     literal type\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Extra query params to add to the request.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        language\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        language:         string\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         string\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    To help templating; you may want to use the simplified field Name,\nso you can provide the query language=fr and now Name will be the French name.\nThis is also extended to other string fields such as Descriptions.\nSearch will use the language parameter to decide which field to query the string against,\nfor example: language=fr&string=LeAwsome will search for LeAwesome on the field Name_fr.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        servers\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        servers:     string[]\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     string[]\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Servers for the market endpoint.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        staging\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        staging:         boolean\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         boolean\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    Should this request be fired against staging environment?

website: https://xivapi.github.io/angular-client/\nInstallation\nSimply run npm i --save @xivapi/angular-client\nQuick start\nAdd XivapiClientModule to your AppModule imports:\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [\n        AppComponent,\n    ],\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        XivapiClientModule.forRoot(),        \n        ...\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}In the other modules, don't call forRoot again, just import the module itself.\nThen you can simply inject the service wherever you want to use it:\n@Component({\n    ...\n})\nexport class FooComponent {\n    \n    public items$: Observable>;\n    \n    constructor(private xivapi: XivapiService){\n        this.items$ = this.xivapi.getList(XivapiEndpoint.Items);\n    }\n}Use with private_key (Google Cloud Function)\n\nCreate a google cloud function, name it as you want.\nInsert following code (with your key):\n\nexports.xivapiProxy = (req, res) => {\n  let request = require('request');\n  const apiKey = '>';\n  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '')\n     .set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');\n  const url = Buffer.from(req.query.url,
